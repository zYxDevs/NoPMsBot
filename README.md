## IMPORTANT NOTICE:

This project is no longer maintained, and should be considered deprecated. __Use at your own risk__.

Telegram have made many breaking changes since this bot was last updated, and as such, there are no expectations that
this will work. Notably, user IDs have gone from 32 bit to 64, which will cause issues with the database that I do not believe are worth fixing.

If you are simply looking for a feedback bot to use, I would like to encourage giving
[NoPMsBot](https://t.me/TopicSupport/87) a try; it was built as [NoPMsBot](https://t.me/shriMADhaBot)'s successor, and has many of the same features (but is much faster and better with [the latest Topic](https://t.me/TelegramTips/362) features)!
